    <p>
        <b>Hello. We are a network of neighbors living in upper Morningside Heights that have self-organized in order to support one another through the coronavirus pandemic.</b> 
    </p>


    <p>
        We don't know how long this will last, or what our needs will be yet, but we know that we'll all be better off if we help each other through it.
        Most of our members live between Broadway and Riverside and 122nd and 125th, but we welcome neighbors from the surrounding areas as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page exists to help neighbors get in touch, so we can help each other weather the current crisis. We plan to post resources here about how to stay healthy, how to support local businesses, and how to get involved with our community.
    </p>
